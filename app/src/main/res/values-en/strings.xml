    <string name="CryptocurrencyABC">What is cryptocurrency?</string>
    <string name="CryptocurrencyABCData"> "\t" A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital
        asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to
        secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and
        verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control
        as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.
        "\n \t" The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger
        technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction
        database.
        "\n \t" Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is generally considered
        the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Since the release of bitcoin, over 6,000
        altcoins (alternative variants of bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies) have been
        created.
